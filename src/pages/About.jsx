            <p>Welcome! I have a wide range of professional, academic, and 
                personal experience in the fields that inspire me the most 
                (this includes the social media and music industries in 
                addition to software/tech). My background spans from content 
                creation and community building to web development and data 
                analysis, all of which are consistently driven by my passion 
                for creation and collaboration.  My workflow is about merging 
                my creativity with technical expertise to bring innovative 
                solutions to the digital space. </p>
